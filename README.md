### Product idea
* An android app that allow its user to share unused space with others. 

### Who is your audience?
* We hope our first group of audience can be UCSB students and nearby residents, or… could simply be anyone. 

### What problem do you solve?
* Luggage storage
* Parking lot sharing
* Pets fosterage
* Short-term lease
* Short-term Bike/Car rental

And so on … 

### MORE FEATURES WILL BE ADDED

### Think about how people currently do things like you propose to be done with your app, and how your solution will improve things for your audience.
* At the end of each of quarter, students have to move out their belongings. It is hard to find a space to place their luggages and other belongings. SpaceRenter could allow people who is in demand to find someone else who is willing to rent their room in a short term.
* Some apartments in IV only provide one parking for lot for each unit, but there are more than one tenant have a car, and they need to find more parking space. SpaceRenter could allow people rent out their extra parking space to someone in demand.
* When you and your family are planning for a vacation, but worrying about no one could take care of your pets, SpaceRenter could allow its user to find someone who is responsible to take good care of your pets.
* Residence halls and some off-campus apartments would be closed during  summer. SpaceRenter could help students find someone who is looking to sublease their apartment. 
* If you are visiting UCSB or you want to use bike/car for a short term, you can see who is renting a bike/car. Usually, most of students will leave their bikes in apartments iv. Anyone in demand can rent them in our app.
